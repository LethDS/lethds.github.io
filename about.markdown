### Mission of Lethbridge Data Science
From bus routes, to landscape maps, to housing prices, data is being accumulated at an increasing rate. This presents an opportunity to use these data to tackle environmental and social challenges we face today. Similarly, it presents great opportunities for augmenting current business practices and developing completely new business models. This Lethbridge Data Science siteâ€™s goal is to help bring together the community of data scientists working in and around Lethbridge, and to help guide new comers interested in the world of data science.
