Welcome to the Lethbridge Data Science group! We are a group of data scientists working together to learn and apply data science to projects in Lethbridge and beyond. We are an open and diverse community, with some individuals more adept at applying and coming up with great project ideas, while others are more interested in the nuts and bolts of building the latest machine learning algorithms. We belive that as a diverse groups we can build better projects.

Feel free to get in touch with us at lethbridgedatascience@gmail.com if you are interested in getting involved or if you think youâ€™ve got a great idea for a data science project! Also if you've already run an intersting project and would like to showcase contact us if you'd like to add it to our portfolio page. Similarly, if you'd like to see what other's have done check out our portfolio page!
